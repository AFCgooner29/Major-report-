\section{Future Scope}
To analyze OSM data using NetworkX is ideal for small data sets but when data becomes large this approach becomes vague and at that point we need a new technology which incorporates Big Data and such technologies are Hadoop, Apache Spark and various others, but Hadoop and Apache Spark are the most popular, Apache spark is 100 times faster than mapreduce pardigm in Hadoop, Graphframes API is used as it supports Python and Larger datasets can be analyzed in future of this project.\\
The analyzed data can be used for various purposes like urban planning and improving quality of traffic to make roads safer and better. Construction of new roads or starting metro or bus services might benifit this anlysis and provide good quality service to the commuters.
