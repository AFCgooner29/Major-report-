We have written some scripts for some basic graph plotting and some analysis.\\
Below is one of the experimental result.\\

\section{Conclusions}
We concluded some information using processing times and other analysis as follows:  
\subsection{When to use NetworkX}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Unlike many other tools, it is designed to handle data on a scale relevant to
	modern problems.
	\item Most of the core algorithms rely on extremely fast legacy code
	\item Highly flexible graph implementations (a graph/node can be anything!)
	\item Extensive set of native readable and writable formats
	\item Takes advantage of Pythonâ€™s ability to pull data from the Internet or databases
\end{itemize}
\subsection{When not to use NetworkX}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Large-scale problems that require faster approaches (i.e. massive networks
	with 100M/1B edges)
	\item Better use of memory/threads than Python (large objects, parallel computation)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Isochrone Maps with OSMnx + Python}
How far can you travel on foot in 15 minutes? Urban planners use isochrone maps to show spatial horizons (i.e., isolines) that are equal in time. Isochrones depict areas according to how long it takes to arrive there from some point. These visualizations are particularly useful in transportation planning as they reveal what places are accessible within a set of time horizons.

We can create isochrone maps for anywhere in the world automatically with Python and its OSMnx package:
 
 
You can create your own travel time maps for any city in the world by following this example in the new OSMnx examples GitHub repo. OSMnx is a Python package for easily downloading, analyzing, and visualizing OpenStreetMap street networks anywhere in the world. Installation instructions and demonstrations are on Geoffboing's GitHub.\\

We can also visualize this by which points along the network we can reach within 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 minutes}
