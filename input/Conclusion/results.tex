\section{Experimental Results}
We have written some scripts for some basic graph plotting and some analysis.\\
Below is one of the experimental result.\\

Script to create road networks

\begin{description}
	
	\item [\ import osmnx as ox]\\
	\item [\ T ="#Place osm tag here"]
	\item [\ ox.plot\_graph(ox.graph\_from\_place(T))]\\
	
\end{description}

\section{Conclusions}
We concluded some information using processing times and other analysis as follows:  
\subsection{When to use NetworkX}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Unlike many other tools, it is designed to handle data on a scale relevant to
	modern problems.
	\item Most of the core algorithms rely on extremely fast legacy code
	\item Highly flexible graph implementations (a graph/node can be anything!)
	\item Extensive set of native readable and writable formats
	\item Takes advantage of Pythonâ€™s ability to pull data from the Internet or databases
\end{itemize}
\subsection{When not to use NetworkX}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Large-scale problems that require faster approaches (i.e. massive networks
	with 100M/1B edges)
	\item Better use of memory/threads than Python (large objects, parallel computation)
\end{itemize}
