We, students of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, have taken efforts in this project.
However, it would not have been possible without the kind support and help of many individuals
and organizations. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all of them.\\

The author is highly grateful to Dr. M.S. Saini Director, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana for providing her with the opportunity to carry out his Major Project in this estimed college, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana.\\

The author would like to whole heartedly thank Dr. Sukhjit Singh Sehra, Training Coordinator, CSE department, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana who is a vast sea of knowledge and without whose constant and never ending support and motivation, it would never have been possible to complete the project and other assignments so efficiently and effectively.\\

Finally, I would like to thank all the organisations and indivisuals who created such great tools and algorithms and helped us to complete the project.
