\section{Overview}
\subsection{What is OSM?}
OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices. OSM is considered a prominent example of volunteered geographic information.\\

Created by Steve Coast in the UK in 2004, it was inspired by the success of Wikipedia and the predominance of proprietary map data in the UK and elsewhere. Since then, it has grown to over 2 million registered users, who can collect data using manual survey, GPS devices, aerial photography, and other free sources. This crowdsourced data is then made available under the Open Database Licence. The site is supported by the OpenStreetMap Foundation, a non-profit organisation registered in England and Wales.\\

Rather than the map itself, the data generated by the OpenStreetMap project is considered its primary output. The data is then available for use in both traditional applications, like its usage by Craigslist, OsmAnd, Geocaching, MapQuest Open, JMP statistical software, and Foursquare to replace Google Maps, and more unusual roles like replacing the default data included with GPS receivers. OpenStreetMap data has been favourably compared with proprietary datasources, though data quality varies worldwide.

\subsection{ Map production}
Map data is collected from scratch by volunteers performing systematic ground surveys using tools such as a handheld GPS unit, a notebook, digital camera, or a voice recorder. The data is then entered into the OpenStreetMap database. Mapathon competition events are also held by OpenStreetMap team and by non-profit organisations and local governments to map a particular area.\\

The availability of aerial photography and other data from commercial and government sources has added important sources of data for manual editing and automated imports. Special processes are in place to handle automated imports and avoid legal and technical problems.
\subsection{ Route planning}

In February 2015, OpenStreetMap added route planning functionality to the map on its official website. The routing uses external services, namely OSRM, GraphHopper and MapQuest.\\

There are other routing providers and applications listed in the official Routing wiki.

\subsection{Data storage}
The OSM data primitives are stored and processed in different formats.\\

The main copy of the OSM data is stored in OSM's main database. The main database is a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension, which has one table for each data primitive, with individual objects stored as rows. All edits happen in this database, and all other formats are created from it.\\

For data transfer, several database dumps are created, which are available for download. The complete dump is called planet.osm. These dumps exist in two formats, one using XML and one using the Protocol Buffer Binary Format (PBF).\\

The LinkedGeoData data uses the GeoSPARQL and well-known text (WKT) RDF vocabularies to represent OpenStreetMap data. It is a work of the Agile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web (AKSW) research group at the University of Leipzig, a group mostly known for DBpedia.


\section{The Existing System}
There are few existing systems for solving this particular problem like Sage or other softwares but
they donâ€™t have following features required by our mentor. These system were not open source
and free web based software that were need.
All exiting system suffers from at least one of the following system.
 \subsection{Limitations of previous system }
\begin{itemize}
\item No batch mode. 

\item Don't give output as png images.

\item They are costly.

\item They don't save output.

\item They need installation and a lot of system resources. 

\item They don't save user session.

\item Earlier it was on CGI, now moved to PHP. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Advantages of shifting the system from CGI to PHP:}
\begin{itemize}
\item PHP was specially designed for a websites, the facilities that web designers typically want in a scripting language are built into it.
\item Another convenience is its handling of form input.
\item Accessing databases is just as easy. There are built-in facilities in PHP to access MySQL, Dbase, Oracle, InterBase, and so on.
\item Need to MIME encode your message? There's a function to do it for you too.
\item When PHP scripts runs, If in case  you get error then messages will be like pinpointing the offending lines in your code to help you locate the error.
\end{itemize} 
\section{User Requirement Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Using OSMnX to get the data from OSM servers.
	\item Using networkX to plot the graph with parrallel processing.
	\item Using simple python program to create the graph. 
	\item Create the road network of an area.
	\item Compare the processing times of the parrallel vs serial processors. 
\end{enumerate}
